For creating new user, we go to manage jenkins and then users.
Here we can create/delete/modify the users.


By default user have full permission due to jenkins defualt setting of Authorization is "logged user can do anything".

If we want to manage user permission as per requirement . 
we need to install plugin "Role-based Authorization Strategy" and then change the authorization setting "role based stategy" under security.

Now we go to manage and assign roles.

We have three user , tech1, dev1 and test1. we need to provide tech1 user for full admin access.
dev1 user can do tast related to dev job (dev1, dev2, dev3) and test1 user can do job related to test(test1,test2,test3).
For this we go to Manage and assign roles section and then manage roles. Here we create global role - techteam and specific.
In techteam, we assign overall administrater access. for specific we assign overall read permission.

After that we create item role developer and tester, here we enter pattern dev.* for developer and test.* patteren for tester.
Now we go assign role and add users (tech1, dev1, test1) in global role and click on related field . tech1 to techteam, dev1 and test1 to specific.
After we add users(dev1 and test1) in item role and assign dev1 to developer and test1 to tester.
Here we done. We test after login to specific user logins.
